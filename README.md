Project insights

This is a Project built from scrimba "React-crash-course", it's my first solo React project, built based on one of the 4 Figma Models => `https://www.figma.com/file/4ctPLUvIn5b5Ep6YPOZWWd/Digital-Business-Card?node-id=0%3A1` provided by the course


This project was built on my local machine initialized with the Create React App and pushed back on Github with the Git command line.

Had a hard time including some CSS "@keyframes" feature on the footer, by the time i figured it out turned out that it wasnt as aesthetic as i thought it was, so i end up aborting it, and sticking with the :hover CSS transitions.

it was quite a fun challenge including '<Fontawesome />', in React installing the packages and importing the icons from their libraries using the import from method!
